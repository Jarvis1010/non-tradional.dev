Composing Layouts in React with Travis Waith-Mair, creator of Bedrock Layout Primitives

The day has finally come. I am so happy to share my first course on composing layouts. This course takes all the knowledge I have gained working on two different design systems, as well as my own layout library. Please check it out at [https://www.newline.co/courses/composing-layouts-in-react](https://www.newline.co/courses/composing-layouts-in-react)

### Thoughts On Writing aÂ Course

I thought I would list out a couple of random thoughts in no particular order about what it took to get here:

*   Writing a course is harder than you think, no matter how hard you think it will be.
*   Determine your target audience early and keep them involved at all stages of the creation process.
*   Feedback from your target audience is more important that your peers
*   Open Source is a great carrier tool
*   Even if you donâ€™t think you are ready to write a course, you are.

Thanks again for subscribing and checking out my course and donâ€™t forget to check out my new twitch, [https://www.twitch.tv/buildingbedrocklayout](https://www.twitch.tv/buildingbedrocklayout) where I stream every wednesday building the Bedrock Layout Primitives library.
